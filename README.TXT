This project is a maze solver. Mazes which are created using txt files are solved through java code. Two mazes are in the folder, (maze and maze1) which can be used to solve through java code. The purpose of this project is to solve mazes in a matter of time. 

To start this project, please download this project to your complier and run through MazeDriver.java. After you run it, you will insert the name of the file, and the code will solve the maze. 

If you would like to create your own maze, create a maze using the hash symbol (#) making there that there is one pathway. Please make sure to specify the number of rows, columns, where the row starts, where the columns start, where the end row starts, and where the columns end on the top of the .txt file. If you look at the first line of the maze.txt file, you will see that the numbers 13(# of rows), 12 (number of columns) 1(where row starts), 0(where column starts), 11(where row ends), and 11(where column ends) are specified.
